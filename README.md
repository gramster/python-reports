# python-reports
Reports for my team on open GitHub issues that need attention.

There are daily reports with incremental updates for past day only,
and weekly reports with all relevant issues (available Monday mornings).
Daily reports use the weekday name so wrap around after 7 days.

While it would be nice to generate the dailies all in one workflow
and same for the weeklys, each report is a separate workflow with
30 minutes between to avoid Github API rate limiting.
